You walk up to the accoutant with a name tag saying "Flo Cashe" and she says:

"Sorry I really don't wanna talk to you right now. I am so stressed out because one of our competiors has been getting private information leaked to them and they are doing much better than us. The boss is making me find new ways of saving money all week and its really been getting to me. Whoever is leaking info is most likely the culprit."

You walk up to the CEO and he says:

"What do you want can't you see I'm busy! My name is C E Overclock and I am the boss of this office. You should be investigating the crime instead of talking to me. If you ask me, Lin Uxford is the laziest person here. I wouldn't be suprised if she tried to sink this company herself. Now leave me alone!"

Ty Poe says:

"Oh you heard that? You must've misheard I am just an intern here. I don't know what you are talking about. Okay.. Listen I am just trying to make a little money. I don't really care about how much work went into making all of the programs they made here. If I can take credit for everything and sell a little data, that is all I care about. Arrest me if you want"

*1.7 Honor confidentiality.
*2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review.
*2.6 Perform work only in areas of competence.<<else>>Aww! Too Bad! You chose $accused as the culprit but they were innocent. You should try a little harder to find clues throughout the office. Some actions may seem like they lead nowhere but try them anyways.<</if>>

You walk up to the supervisor and she says:

"Sorry I am a little busy at the moment. It is not easy not doing any work and making sure everyone else is doing their job. Especially when it comes to Ty Poe. It is like this guy has never coded in his entire life. I saw a lot of promise in him but he just can't do anything. Though, I don't think he would be capable of this murder."
