# FinalProject_CS239

In this project, you go through a text based murder mystery where you are a detective trying to find the culprit of a murdered computer in an office space. The culprit is someone who does not follow the ACM guidelines provided online.

You are able to talk to the different suspects and interact a little with some parts of the office.

To win the game you need to accuse the right suspect using the knowledge of the ACM guidelines you gained during your time in CS200 with the amazing professor Andy Harris.

Enjoy!
